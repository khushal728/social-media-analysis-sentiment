# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from social media posts to understand public opinion and trends. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model classifies text data into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.

# Features

Data Collection: Scrapes or imports social media posts from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or others.

Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text data for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Classifies posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Visualization: Provides insights using sentiment distribution graphs, word clouds, and trend analysis.

Model Training & Evaluation: Uses machine learning or deep learning models to enhance accuracy.

# Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

TextBlob

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy


Matplotlib & Seaborn

# Usage

Load your dataset (CSV or scraped data from social media).

Run the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text.

Apply sentiment analysis models to classify the text.

Visualize the results to gain insights into public sentiment.

# Future Enhancements

Integrate deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers.

Expand support for multiple languages.

Automate real-time sentiment tracking.

Develop a web dashboard for easy interaction.
